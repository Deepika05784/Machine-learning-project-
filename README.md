### üìå Overview

This project is a machine learning pipeline built using . It focuses on solving a classification/regression problem by applying data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation techniques. The goal is to build a predictive model that can deliver accurate and actionable insights from the given dataset.

### üìä Dataset

* The dataset used in this project contains structured data with multiple numerical and categorical features.
* It was imported as a CSV file and loaded into a  DataFrame for cleaning and analysis.
* The dataset includes columns such as:

  * **Features**: (e.g., demographic details, transaction/activity metrics, or domain-specific parameters)
  * **Target**: A column indicating the class or continuous value to predict.
* Missing values, duplicates, and outliers were handled during preprocessing to improve data quality.
